## 1. Research Objective & Problem Definition

### What We Are Building

**GraphQMap** is a single ML model that outputs initial qubit layouts (mappings from logical qubits to physical qubits) for quantum circuit compilation. The model must:

- Work across **multiple quantum hardware backends** without hardware-specific fine-tuning (hardware-agnostic)
- Handle **multi-programming** scenarios: compiling 1, 2, or 4 quantum circuits simultaneously onto a single backend
- Achieve high **PST (Probability of Successful Trials)** on NISQ hardware
- Run with **fast inference speed**

### What the Model Does NOT Do

GraphQMap outputs **only the initial layout**. All subsequent compilation stages — routing, optimization, scheduling — are handled by `qiskit.transpile()` with `routing_method='sabre'`. The model does not perform routing or scheduling.

### The Non-Differentiability Problem

The pipeline has a non-differentiable barrier:

```
GraphQMap → Initial Layout (A) → [qiskit transpile / SABRE — NON-DIFFERENTIABLE] → Compiled Circuit (B) → PST Evaluation
```

The model cannot receive gradients through SABRE routing. This constraint shapes the entire training strategy.

### Key Environment

- **Hardware:** Qiskit FakeBackendV2
- **Native 2-Qubit Gates:** `cx`, `ecr`, or `cz` (varies by backend; model abstracts over gate type via error/duration features)
- **Circuit Format:** OpenQASM (`.qasm`)
- **Target Metric:** PST (Probability of Successful Trials) maximization

## 2. Core Pipeline

### Inference Pipeline (Complete)

```
Input: Quantum circuit (.qasm) + Target hardware (FakeBackendV2)
  ↓
[Circuit Graph Construction] → Circuit graph with node/edge features
[Hardware Graph Construction] → Hardware graph with node/edge features (including noise)
  ↓
[Circuit GNN Encoder] → C (l×d) matrix, l = logical qubits, d = 64
[Hardware GNN Encoder] → H (h×d) matrix, h = physical qubits, d = 64
  ↓
[Cross-Attention Module] → C' (l×d), H' (h×d)  (2 layers of bidirectional cross-attention)
  ↓
[Score Head] → S (l×h) = (C'·W_q) × (H'·W_k)ᵀ / √d_k
  ↓
[Dummy Padding] → S_padded (h×h) by appending (h-l) dummy rows (zeros)
  ↓
[Log-domain Sinkhorn] → P (h×h) doubly stochastic matrix
  ↓
[Hungarian Algorithm] → Discrete one-to-one mapping (use top l rows only)
  ↓
Output: Initial layout (logical qubit → physical qubit mapping)
  ↓
[qiskit.transpile(initial_layout=output, routing_method='sabre')] → Compiled circuit
  ↓
[Noise simulation / hardware execution] → PST measurement
```

### Training Pipeline

Same as above except:
- **No Hungarian algorithm** during training — P matrix is used directly for loss computation
- **Sinkhorn temperature τ** is annealed during Stage 1

### Multi-Programming Pipeline

For multiple circuits (e.g., C₁ with l₁ qubits, C₂ with l₂ qubits):
1. Merge circuit graphs into a single **disconnected graph**
2. Circuit GNN output becomes (l₁+l₂)×d
3. Rest of pipeline is identical — Sinkhorn's doubly stochastic constraint automatically prevents mapping conflicts
4. **No architectural modifications required**

---

## 3. Graph Representation

### 3.1 Circuit Graph

**Node:** Each logical qubit = one node.

**Edge:** Undirected. An edge exists between logical qubits i and j if any 2-qubit gate connects them. Multiple gates on the same pair are merged into a single edge.

**Node Features (per logical qubit):**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gate_count` | Total number of gates on this qubit |
| `two_qubit_gate_count` | Number of 2-qubit gates involving this qubit |
| `degree` | Number of distinct qubits this qubit interacts with via 2-qubit gates |
| `circuit_depth_participation` | Fraction of circuit depth in which this qubit is active (not idle) |

**Edge Features (per qubit pair):**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `interaction_count` | Number of 2-qubit gates between this qubit pair |
| `earliest_interaction` | Normalized time (0~1) of the first 2-qubit gate between this pair |
| `latest_interaction` | Normalized time (0~1) of the last 2-qubit gate between this pair |

**Multi-Programming Global Summary Features:**

When multiple circuits are merged, each node additionally receives a **circuit-level global summary vector** concatenated to its local features. All nodes from the same circuit share identical summary values.

| Summary Feature | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `total_qubits` | Total logical qubit count of the circuit this node belongs to |
| `total_2q_gates` | Total 2-qubit gate count of the circuit |
| `total_depth` | Total circuit depth |
| `gate_density` | Gate density of the circuit |

These summary values are z-score normalized across the **entire training dataset** (not per-circuit).

**Circuit Node Feature Normalization:** Z-score normalized **within each circuit** (so "gate_count" reflects relative busyness within that circuit, not absolute count).

**Exception handling:** If standard deviation = 0 (all qubits identical), add ε = 1e-8 to denominator.

### 3.2 Hardware Graph

**Node:** Each physical qubit = one node.

**Edge:** Undirected. Edges from FakeBackendV2 coupling map.

**Node Features (per physical qubit):**

| Feature | Description | Direction |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `T1` | Energy relaxation time | Higher = better |
| `T2` | Phase relaxation time | Higher = better |
| `frequency` | Qubit frequency | Not directly good/bad |
| `readout_error` | Measurement error rate | Lower = better |
| `single_qubit_error` | Average single-qubit gate error rate | Lower = better |
| `degree` | Coupling map connectivity degree | Structural info |

**Edge Features (per physical connection):**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cx_error` | 2-qubit gate error rate on this connection |
| `cx_duration` | 2-qubit gate execution time on this connection |

**Hardware Feature Normalization:** All noise-related features (T1, T2, frequency, readout_error, single_qubit_error, cx_error, cx_duration) are **z-score normalized within each backend independently**. This ensures the model learns relative quality rankings within a hardware, enabling cross-hardware generalization.

`degree` (structural) is also z-score normalized within each backend.

**Exception handling:** Same ε = 1e-8 for zero standard deviation.

## 4. Model Architecture

### 4.1 Overview

```
[Circuit Graph] → Circuit GNN (3-layer GATv2) → C (l×d)
[Hardware Graph] → Hardware GNN (3-layer GATv2) → H (h×d)

Cross-Attention Layer 1:
  C = LayerNorm(C + CrossAttn(Q=C, K=H, V=H))
  C = LayerNorm(C + FFN(C))
  H = LayerNorm(H + CrossAttn(Q=H, K=C, V=C))
  H = LayerNorm(H + FFN(H))

Cross-Attention Layer 2:
  C' = LayerNorm(C + CrossAttn(Q=C, K=H, V=H))
  C' = LayerNorm(C' + FFN(C'))
  H' = LayerNorm(H + CrossAttn(Q=H, K=C, V=C))
  H' = LayerNorm(H' + FFN(H'))

Score Head: S = (C'·W_q) × (H'·W_k)ᵀ / √d_k  → l×h
Dummy Padding → h×h
Log-domain Sinkhorn(S/τ) → P (h×h)

[Training] P used directly for loss
[Inference] Hungarian(P) → discrete mapping (top l rows only)
```

### 4.2 Dual GNN Encoder (GATv2)

Two independent GNN networks (no shared parameters) using the same architectural template.

**Architecture per GNN:**

```
Input Features → Linear(input_dim, d) → d-dimensional projection
→ GATv2 Layer 1 → BatchNorm → ELU → Residual Connection
→ GATv2 Layer 2 → BatchNorm → ELU → Residual Connection
→ GATv2 Layer 3 → BatchNorm → ELU → Residual Connection
→ Linear(d, d) → Final node embedding
```

**Edge Feature Integration in GATv2:**

Edge features are concatenated into attention score computation:

```
e_ij = LeakyReLU(a^T · [W·h_i || W·h_j || W_e·edge_feat_ij])
α_ij = softmax_j(e_ij)
h_i' = Σ_j α_ij · V·h_j
```

`W_e` is a separate learnable matrix that projects edge features into the attention space.

**Residual Connection:**

```python
h_out = GATv2Layer(h_in) + h_in  # Applied on layers 2, 3
```

**GNN Hyperparameters:**

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Embedding dimension (d) | 64 | Shared by both GNNs and cross-attention |
| GATv2 Layers | 3 | 3-hop information aggregation |
| Attention Heads | 4 | 16 dims per head |
| Activation | ELU | |
| Dropout | 0.1 | |
| BatchNorm | Per layer | |
| Residual Connections | Layers 2, 3 | |

**Input dimensions:**
- Circuit GNN input: `num_circuit_node_features` (4 local + 4 global summary for multi-prog = 8 max)
- Hardware GNN input: `num_hardware_node_features` (6: T1, T2, freq, readout_err, sq_err, degree)
- Circuit edge features: 3 (interaction_count, earliest, latest)
- Hardware edge features: 2 (cx_error, cx_duration)

### 4.3 Cross-Attention Interaction Module

Inserted between GNN encoding and Score Head. Enables circuit and hardware embeddings to mutually reference each other.

**Purpose:** Simple dot-product between GNN outputs only captures similarity. Good mapping requires capturing **complementary** relationships (busy logical qubit → high-quality physical qubit). Cross-attention enables this.

**Structure (repeated 2 times):**

```python
# Layer n (n = 1, 2):
C = LayerNorm(C + MultiHeadCrossAttention(Q=C, K=H, V=H))
C = LayerNorm(C + FFN(C))

H = LayerNorm(H + MultiHeadCrossAttention(Q=H, K=C, V=C))
H = LayerNorm(H + FFN(H))
```

After 2 layers, output is C' (l×d) and H' (h×d).

**Cross-Attention Hyperparameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cross-Attention Layers | 2 |
| Attention Heads | 4 |
| FFN Hidden Dim | 128 (2×d) |
| Dropout | 0.1 |

### 4.4 Score Head

Learned projection from cross-attention output to mapping compatibility scores:

```
S_ij = (C'_i · W_q)^T · (H'_j · W_k) / √d_k
```

- `W_q`: learnable matrix d → d_k (d_k = 64)
- `W_k`: learnable matrix d → d_k (d_k = 64)
- Scaled by `√d_k` for numerical stability before Sinkhorn

**Output:** S matrix of shape (l × h)

### 4.5 Dummy Padding

Since l < h, append (h - l) dummy rows of zeros to S, creating an h×h square matrix.

**Dummy row initial values:** 0 (or small constant)

**Rationale for dummy padding over rectangular Sinkhorn:**
1. Standard Sinkhorn convergence guarantees preserved
2. Hungarian algorithm directly compatible (works on square matrices)
3. Gradient flow unaffected (dummy rows not connected to learnable params)
4. Simple implementation: `torch.nn.functional.pad`

### 4.6 Log-Domain Sinkhorn

**CRITICAL: Use log-domain implementation for numerical stability at low τ.**

```python
def log_sinkhorn(log_alpha, max_iter=20, tol=1e-6):
    """
    log_alpha: h×h matrix (= S_padded / τ, already in log domain)
    """
    for i in range(max_iter):
        # Row normalization in log domain
        log_alpha = log_alpha - torch.logsumexp(log_alpha, dim=1, keepdim=True)
        # Column normalization in log domain
        log_alpha = log_alpha - torch.logsumexp(log_alpha, dim=0, keepdim=True)
        
        # Early stopping check
        if (log_alpha.exp().sum(dim=1) - 1).abs().max() < tol:
            break
    
    return log_alpha.exp()  # Return P matrix
```

**Sinkhorn Hyperparameters:**

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| τ_max (initial) | 1.0 | Soft distribution at Stage 1 start |
| τ_min (final) | 0.05 | Near one-hot; minimizes train-inference gap |
| τ Schedule | Exponential decay | `τ(epoch) = τ_max · (τ_min/τ_max)^(epoch/total_epochs)` |
| Stage 1 | Annealing from τ_max to τ_min | |
| Stage 2 | Fixed at τ_min = 0.05 | |
| Max Iterations | 20 | |
| Early Stop Tolerance | 1e-6 | |
| Implementation | Log-domain | Prevents overflow at low τ |

### 4.7 Hungarian Algorithm (Inference Only)

Applied to P matrix to produce discrete mapping. Only the top l rows (actual logical qubits) of the result are used. Dummy row assignments are discarded.

Use `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` with cost matrix `(1 - P)` (since Hungarian minimizes cost, and we want to maximize assignment probability).

---

## 5. Training Strategy: 2-Stage Curriculum

> **Note:** RL fine-tuning has been excluded from scope. The training consists of 2 stages only.

### 5.1 Stage 1: Supervised Pre-training

**Objective:** Learn the basic sense of what constitutes a good qubit mapping.

**Training Order:** MLQD + QUEKO (large quantity, existing labels) → QUEKO only (high quality true optimal, fine-tuning)

**Optimizer:** AdamW with cosine annealing LR scheduler.

**Loss Function: Cross-Entropy**

Ground truth layout π is converted to binary permutation matrix Y (h×h):
- Y[i, π(i)] = 1 for each logical qubit i
- All other entries = 0
- Dummy rows in Y are set to complete the permutation (each assigned to a remaining physical qubit)

```
L_sup = -Σ_i Σ_j Y_ij · log(P_ij)
```

**Sinkhorn τ:** Annealed from τ_max=1.0 to τ_min=0.05 via exponential decay.

**MLQD + QUEKO → QUEKO-only Transition:**
- Criterion: Validation cross-entropy loss early stopping (patience = 5–10 epochs)
- When switching to QUEKO: reduce learning rate to 1/5–1/10 of previous LR
- QUEKO termination: same validation CE loss early stopping

### 5.2 Stage 2: Noise-Aware Surrogate Metric Fine-tuning

**Objective:** Fine-tune toward actual NISQ PST correlation without running the full transpile pipeline.

**Data:** All available circuits including QASMBench and RevLib (no labels required). Labeled datasets (MQT Bench, MLQD, QUEKO) can also be included for surrogate fine-tuning.

**Sinkhorn τ:** Fixed at 0.05.

**Optimizer:** AdamW with cosine annealing. Warm-up 3–5 epochs recommended.

#### Loss Term 1: L_surr — Error-Aware Edge Quality Loss

Uses error-accumulated shortest path distance instead of simple hop count:

```
d_error(p, q) = shortest_path_weighted(coupling_map, weight=cx_error)
```

Precompute using Floyd-Warshall with cx_error as edge weights. Store as h×h lookup matrix per backend.

```
L_surr = (1/|E_circuit|) · Σ_{(i,j)∈E_circuit} Σ_{p,q} P_ip · P_jq · d_error(p,q)
```

Where E_circuit = set of logical qubit pairs connected by 2-qubit gates.

Fully differentiable w.r.t. P (d_error is a precomputed constant).

#### Loss Term 2: L_node — NISQ Node Quality Loss

Drives important logical qubits to high-quality physical qubits.

**q_score function (learnable weighted linear combination):**

```python
q_score(p) = sigmoid(w1*T1_norm + w2*T2_norm + w3*(1-readout_err_norm) + w4*(1-sq_err_norm) + w5*freq_norm + bias)
```

- `w1–w5` and `bias` are **learnable parameters** (initialized to small positive values, e.g., 0.2)
- Features are z-score normalized within backend
- (1 - error) inversion ensures all terms are "higher = better" direction
- Sigmoid bounds output to [0, 1] for scale stability
- After training, inspecting w1–w5 provides insight into which noise factors matter most for PST

**Logical qubit importance w(i):** Number of 2-qubit gates involving qubit i (from circuit graph).

```
L_node = (1/l_total) · (-Σ_i w(i) · Σ_p P_ip · q_score(p))
```

Negative sign: higher quality assignment → lower loss.

#### Loss Term 3: L_sep — Multi-Programming Separation Loss

Encourages physical distance between qubits of different circuits (crosstalk reduction).

```
L_sep = (1/|E_cross|) · (-Σ_{(i,j)∈cross-circuit} Σ_{p,q} P_ip · P_jq · d_hw(p,q))
```

Where E_cross = all pairs (i, j) where i and j belong to different circuits.

**Automatically equals 0 for single-circuit scenarios** (no cross-circuit pairs exist).

#### Combined Stage 2 Loss

```
L_2 = L_surr + α · L_node + λ · L_sep
```

| Weight | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| L_surr coefficient | 1.0 (fixed) | Primary objective, baseline reference |
| α (L_node) | 0.3 | Important for NISQ but secondary to distance |
| λ (L_sep) | 0.1 | Most indirect effect |

**CRITICAL: All three terms are per-pair/per-qubit normalized** (divided by pair count or qubit count). This ensures scales are comparable regardless of circuit/hardware size.

**Verification:** Log each term during training. No single term should dominate by >10×. Grid search candidates: α ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}, λ ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2}.

### 5.3 Stage Transition Criteria

| Transition | Criterion | Details |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| MLQD + QUEKO → QUEKO-only | Validation CE loss early stopping | Patience 10 epochs; LR reduced to 1/10 |
| Stage 1 → Stage 2 | Validation PST convergence | Measure actual PST every 5–10 epochs on 50–100 representative circuits (Hungarian → transpile → noise sim); stop when 3 consecutive measurements improve < 0.5% |
| Stage 2 termination | Validation PST early stopping | Based on actual PST, NOT surrogate loss; surrogate loss improving while PST degrades = overfitting signal |

**Validation PST measurement procedure:**
1. Take P matrix from model
2. Apply Hungarian → discrete layout
3. Run `qiskit.transpile(initial_layout=layout, routing_method='sabre')`
4. Run noise simulation on FakeBackendV2
5. Compute PST

```

**Design rationale:**
- **Circuits and labels are decoupled.** Even within a labeled dataset (e.g., MQT Bench), only a subset may have labels compatible with our experimental setup. The remaining circuits are still valuable for Stage 2 unsupervised training.
- **Label format:** JSON mapping from circuit filename to layout: `{"circuit.qasm": {"backend": "manila", "layout": [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]}, ...}`
- **Split files control training behavior.** Adding new labels or circuits only requires updating `labels/*.json` and `splits/*.json` — no reorganization of circuit files.
- **QASMBench and RevLib** have no `labels/` directory entry (always unsupervised, Stage 2 only).
#### Dataset Preprocessing Pipeline

All raw circuit datasets undergo the following preprocessing before use in training. Each step is applied once and the results are stored in place.

**Step 1: Gate Normalization** (`scripts/normalize_gates.py`)
- All QASM files are transpiled to Qiskit standard basis gates `{cx, id, rz, sx, x}` via `transpile(circuit, basis_gates=..., optimization_level=0)` (pure decomposition, no gate optimization/merging)
- **Why:** Original datasets use incompatible gate sets — QUEKO uses only `x`/`cx`, MLQD uses `h`/`cx`/`sx`, while MQT Bench/RevLib contain 3+ qubit gates (`ccx`, `mcx`, `cswap`) that are invisible to the 2-qubit-only feature extraction in `circuit_graph.py` (`len(qubit_indices) == 2` condition). Without decomposition, multi-qubit gate interactions are completely missing from the circuit graph.
- Qubit counts are preserved (transpile does not add ancillas at optimization_level=0)

**Step 2: Untranspilable Circuit Removal**
- Circuits that cannot be transpiled within reasonable time/memory are removed
- Removed: `grover_n26.qasm`, `grover_n28.qasm` (MQT Bench) — 26/28-qubit custom gate wrapping entire circuit, transpile exceeds 10 min
- Removed: 32 circuits with QASM file size > 10 MB (24 from MQT Bench, 8 from RevLib) — Qiskit DAG parsing requires tens of GB memory, causing OOM

**Step 3: Evaluation Benchmark Deduplication**
- Circuits in `data/circuits/qasm/benchmarks/` (23 evaluation circuits) are checked against all training datasets for filename overlap
- Removed from training sets: 17 RevLib circuits + 2 MQT Bench circuits (`bv_n3`, `bv_n4`) that duplicate benchmark circuits
- **Why:** Training on evaluation circuits would make PST benchmarks unfair

**Step 4: Extreme Circuit Filtering** (edges > 1,000)
- Circuits with more than 1,000 unique 2Q qubit pairs (edges in the circuit interaction graph) are removed
- Removed: 182 MQT Bench + 1 QASMBench = 183 circuits
- **Why:** These are fully-connected circuits (QFT, QPE at 60-127Q with up to 8,001 edges) that cause GNN message passing memory/compute explosion and batch size imbalance. The labeled datasets (QUEKO/MLQD) have max 88/24 edges respectively — 1,000 provides 11× headroom while filtering extreme outliers.
- After filtering, max edges = 996

**Preprocessing summary:**

| Step | Circuits Removed | Reason |
|------|:----------------:|--------|
| Gate normalization | 0 (in-place) | Standardize gate representation |
| Untranspilable | 34 | OOM / timeout during transpile |
| Benchmark dedup | 19 | Evaluation fairness |
| Extreme filtering | 183 | edges > 1,000, GNN scalability |
| **Total removed** | **236** | |

**Original → Final circuit counts:**

| Dataset | Original | Final | Removed |
|---------|:--------:|:-----:|:-------:|
| QUEKO | 900 | 900 | 0 |
| MLQD | 4,443 | 4,443 | 0 |
| MQT Bench | 1,448 | 1,219 | 229 |
| QASMBench | 111 | 94 | 17 |
| RevLib | 263 | 231 | 32 |
| **Total** | **7,165** | **6,887** | **278** |

#### QUEKO Backend Handling

QUEKO circuits are designed for 4 specific hardware topologies (Aspen-4, Tokyo, Rochester, Sycamore) that are not available as Qiskit FakeBackendV2. Since QUEKO only provides coupling maps without noise data, we generate **synthetic noise profiles** by sampling from distributions observed across real FakeBackendV2 hardware:

- Noise values (T1, T2, frequency, readout_error, sq_gate_error, cx_error, cx_duration) are sampled from clipped normal distributions fitted to 11 real FakeBackends
- Generated once with fixed seed (42) for reproducibility, stored in `data/circuits/backends/`
- QUEKO's optimal layouts are topology-based (zero-SWAP), so synthetic noise does not affect label correctness
- The model learns topology-aware mapping from QUEKO in Stage 1; noise-aware optimization follows in Stage 2

See `scripts/generate_queko_noise.py` for the generation script.

#### MLQD Backend and Label Handling

MLQD provides OLSQ2-mapped result circuits but not explicit initial layouts. Layouts are extracted by:

1. Parsing measurement lines in the result circuit to obtain the **final mapping** (logical → physical after all SWAPs)
2. Detecting SWAP patterns (3-CNOT decomposition: `cx a,b; cx b,a; cx a,b`) and reversing them to recover the **initial layout**
3. Circuits where SWAP detection fails (pattern mismatch) are kept as unlabeled for Stage 2

**Backend mapping for MLQD:**
- **Melbourne, Rochester** → Qiskit FakeMelbourneV2 / FakeRochesterV2 (real noise data available)
- **Aspen-4, Sycamore** → reuse QUEKO synthetic noise profiles (identical topologies)
- **Grid 5x5** → dedicated synthetic noise profile (`mlqd_grid5x5.json`)

See `scripts/process_mlqd.py` for the extraction script.

### Training Strategy: Hybrid Supervised + Unsupervised

**Stage 1 (Supervised):** Use existing labels directly from MLQD (OLSQ2 solver labels) and QUEKO (τ⁻¹ true optimal). No self-generated label pipeline required — existing labels provide sufficient supervised signal for learning basic mapping quality, and any router-specific bias is corrected in Stage 2.

**Stage 2 (Unsupervised):** Fine-tune with surrogate losses (L_surr, L_node, L_sep) on all available circuits, including label-free datasets (MQT Bench, QASMBench, RevLib). This stage aligns the model toward SABRE routing and NISQ-aware PST optimization, compensating for any mismatch between existing labels and the SABRE pipeline.

### Rationale for Using Existing Labels

- **MLQD OLSQ2 labels** were optimized for the OLSQ2 routing pipeline, but still encode meaningful mapping quality signal (e.g., minimizing qubit interaction distance)
- **QUEKO τ⁻¹ labels** are true topology-optimal mappings (zero-SWAP overhead) — the highest quality supervised signal available
- **MQT Bench** was initially considered for pseudo-labels but excluded because mapped-level data is effectively unavailable from MQT Bench web/API
- **Stage 2 unsupervised fine-tuning corrects router-specific bias** — L_surr directly optimizes error-weighted distance aligned with SABRE routing
- This approach **eliminates the massive computational cost** of self-generating labels while maintaining training effectiveness

## 7. Multi-Programming Training Data

### Circuit Combination Rules

- **Hard constraint:** Total logical qubits of combined circuits **must be less than** physical qubit count of target backend
- **Occupancy limit:** Maximum **75%** of physical qubits
- **Occupancy range:** **30–75%** uniformly sampled for diversity
- **Combination method:** Random pairing with diverse circuit sizes

### Training Data Ratio

| Scenario | Proportion |
|----------|------------|
| Single circuit | 50% |
| 2-circuit | 30% |
| 4-circuit | 20% |

### Multi-Programming Circuit Graph Construction

1. Construct individual circuit graphs for each circuit
2. Merge into a single disconnected graph (no edges between circuits)
3. Each node gets its circuit's global summary features concatenated
4. Total node count = l₁ + l₂ + ... (sum of all circuits' logical qubits)

---

## 8. Batching Strategy

### GNN Level

Use **PyTorch Geometric standard batching**: multiple graphs merged into a single disconnected graph with batch index tracking. Handles variable node counts without padding natively.

### Score Matrix Level: Backend-Based Bucketing

**Samples using the same hardware backend are grouped into the same mini-batch.** This ensures:
- All samples in a batch have identical h (physical qubit count)
- Score Matrix / Sinkhorn / Loss computed as 3D tensor `(batch_size × h × h)` in parallel
- Dummy padding amount varies per sample but matrix size is uniform

### Dynamic Batch Size

Batch size determined by total physical qubit budget to maintain consistent GPU memory:

```python
max_total_nodes = 512  # Total physical qubits per batch (tune to GPU memory)

# Effective batch sizes:
# Manila (5Q):     ~102 samples
# Guadalupe (16Q): ~32 samples
# Montreal (27Q):  ~19 samples
```

### Backend Data Balance

- **Backend-level sampling weights:** All backends appear with roughly equal frequency per epoch
- Oversample data-scarce backends, undersample data-rich backends
- **Epoch ordering:** Backend group order randomized each epoch

---

## 9. Evaluation Protocol

### Hardware Split

| Role | Backends |
|------|----------|
| **Training** | **5Q:** Athens, Belem, Bogota, Burlington, Essex, Lima, London, Manila, Ourense, Quito, Rome, Santiago, Valencia, Vigo, Yorktown · **7Q:** Casablanca, Jakarta, Lagos, Nairobi, Oslo, Perth · **15-16Q:** Melbourne, Guadalupe · **20Q:** Almaden, Boeblingen, Johannesburg, Poughkeepsie, Singapore · **27-28Q:** Algiers, Auckland, Cairo, Cambridge, Geneva, Hanoi, Kolkata, Montreal, Mumbai, Paris, Peekskill, Sydney · **33Q:** Prague · **53Q:** Rochester · **65Q:** Manhattan · **127Q:** Brisbane, Cusco, Kawasaki, Kyiv, Kyoto, Osaka, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Washington |
| **Test (UNSEEN)** | **FakeToronto (27Q)**, **FakeBrooklyn (65Q)**, **FakeTorino (133Q)** — completely excluded from training |

This split enables rigorous evaluation of **hardware-agnostic generalization**.

### Test Scenarios

Following baseline research: **1-circuit, 2-circuit, 4-circuit** multi-programming scenarios.

### Metrics

| Type | Metric | Definition |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Primary** | PST (Probability of Successful Trials) | P(correct output) — probability of the ideal most-probable bitstring appearing in noisy execution. Standard definition used in QUEKO and multi-programming papers. |
| **Secondary** | Hellinger Fidelity | Full distribution similarity between ideal and noisy outputs (more nuanced but less standard). |
| **Secondary** | SWAP count, circuit depth | Compilation quality metrics. |
| **Speed** | Inference latency (model forward + Hungarian), end-to-end time (+ transpile) | |

**PST computation pipeline:**
1. Create AerSimulator with `tensor_network` + GPU (cuQuantum) — handles any circuit size without OOM
2. Simulators created **once per backend**, reused across all circuits (ideal_sim + noisy_sim)
3. Transpile circuit with initial layout (via custom PassManager supporting layout×routing combinations)
4. Run ideal simulation (same transpiled circuit, no noise) to find most probable bitstring
5. Run noisy simulation (same transpiled circuit, backend noise model)
6. PST = noisy_counts[ideal_bitstring] / total_shots
7. Supports multi-register circuits (space-separated bitstrings → per-register PST averaged)

**Simulation method priority:** tensor_network+GPU → tensor_network+CPU → statevector (small circuits only)
**Default shots:** 8192
